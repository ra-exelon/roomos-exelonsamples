# Exelon Cisco RoomOS Devices - Rotating Web Widgets
This site contains the source code for rotating web widgets hosted on Webex Devices (RoomOS).

# Requirements
1.  Webex devices running Software version RoomOS 11.2.1 or newer (e.g., Webex Board, Desk, or Room Series).  
2.  Some macros using newer features require newer firmware. See the requirements list specified within each macro.  
3.  Admin user access to endpoint.

# Support Notice
[Support](https://developer.cisco.com/site/support/) for the macros is provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the macro is properly integrated into 3rd party applications.

It is Cisco's intention to ensure macro compatibility across versions as much as possible and Cisco will make every effort to clearly document any differences in the xAPI across versions in the event that a backwards compatibility impacting change is made.
