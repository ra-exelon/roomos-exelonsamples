# Exelon Cisco RoomOS Devices - Macros
Exelon's use of Cisco RoomOS Macros, allow users to customize video conference devices in combination with the User Interface (UI) Extensions.

Cisco sample macros can also be browsed and saved easily from [roomos.cisco.com/macros](https://roomos.cisco.com/macros).

The examples provided are only a sample and NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality.

# Requirements
1.  Webex devices running Software version RoomOS 11.2.1 or newer (e.g., Webex Board, Desk, or Room Series).  
2.  Some macros using newer features require newer firmware. See the requirements list specified within each macro.  
3.  Admin user access to endpoint.

# Support Notice
[Support](https://developer.cisco.com/site/support/) for the macros is provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the macro is properly integrated into 3rd party applications.

It is Cisco's intention to ensure macro compatibility across versions as much as possible and Cisco will make every effort to clearly document any differences in the xAPI across versions in the event that a backwards compatibility impacting change is made.
